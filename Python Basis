Python Basis

Data Structures in Python
1.List
2.Tuple
3.Dictionaries
4.Set

List : lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content
ex: List [ 1,2,3,4,5,6]

Tuple: Tuples are immutable
Ex: tuple = 'Radha','Srikath','Madhavi'

Dictionaries : are mutable
dic ={"a":"radha","b":"srikath", "c":"Madhavi"}

set :a term in mathematics for a sequence consisting of distinct language is also extended in its language by Python and can easily be made using set().
